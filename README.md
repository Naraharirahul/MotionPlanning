# MotionPlanning

This repository contains the assignments and projects related to the Motion planning course.

### Project

The scope of a project is to develop a Hybrid A* alogrithm on a simulated python environment on a non-holonomic car which plans the path for the parking of a car from a initial position.
The car shall travel to a multiple parallel and perpendicular parking spaces by avoiding the obstacles in-between and planning the path accordingly.

### Working

1) Initially a random end points are generated on the TKinter by choosing the parallel parking space button. 
2) Once the goal is selected, by clicking the generate path button, the path would be generated to the goal location.
3) There is one perpendicular parking space which the car parks.
